Kmeans clustering is one of the most popular Unsupervised Learning Techniques
It is used to group together observations using a fixed number of clusters(centroid), and groups the observation based on similarities
Uses Euclidean Distance


*How It Works*
-> Randomly configures centrois in the data space and based on the positions, the algorithm will optimize for the best position    of the centroids
-> The algorithm will iterate until no change in the centrois values occurs or until the number of iterations is reached
